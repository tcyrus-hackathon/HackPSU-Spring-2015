## What Is Project Plutus?

Project Plutus helps people in developing countries through micro-financing. Through Project Plutus your registered Capital One purchases will be rounded to the nearest dollar, and the extra few cents will be donated to microfinancing nonprofits around the world.

## Who We Help

Project Plutus helps people in developing countries through micro-financing. In many places around the world, a microloan of just a few dollars can create a fruit stand or buy a cow to produce valuable milk, but people donâ€™t have access to these invaluable loans. The problem is that many micro-financing non-profit organizations struggle to fulfill the demand for these loans. Project Plutus supports these organizations fight against poverty.

## Real Life Changes

[Kiva](http://www.kiva.org/), one of the many microfinancing companies sponsored through Project Plutus, has provided Viktoria from Kenya. A loan of $275, to buy a dairy cow, will increase the amount of milk supply available to her and her neighbors.

Microloans encourage the creation of businesses and increase education rates in developing countries all over the world. Your help liberates families from poverty all over the world.

Since they were founded in 2005 they have:

* Had over 1 million lenders
* Over $600,000 in loans
* Built a presence in over 80 countries
